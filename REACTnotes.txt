------What React Router Does------

Blog$ npm install --save react-router-dom@4.0.0

Refer to Diagram.
    History is already running behind the scenes when you install react-router-dom@4.0.0. 
    This installs a History library.
    The whole diagram represents SPAs.

------The Basics of React Router------

BrowserRouter handles the history.

src/index.js
    import { BrowserRouter, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

------Our First Route Definitionr------

Because we are using react-router we no longer have a central single component going on so we have no need for components/app.js and it can be deleted.
    sr/components/app.js
        import App from './components/app'; // DELETE THIS ILNE AND IT'S components/app.js file!


------State as an Object------
The current route a user is looking at is really just another piece of state inside our application.

We dont need that 'activePost' piece of state in the state since we simply pull it's ID out of the posts array.
Since ths URL already reflects the post ID --> /posts/5 
Then store POSTs inside an object and not an array as we have in the past.

------Back to Redux - Index action------


~/REACTmodern/Blog$ npm install --save axios redux-promise

    src/index.js (add promise)
        const createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(promise)(createStore);
